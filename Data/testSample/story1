Mauricio Renteria is my beloved friend, he is also a loved brother and a father. He is a Cuban actor who is known and cherished by several generations of cubans. He is currently fighting the battle of his life...for his life. On July 3rd he was diagnosed with cronic lymphatic cancer and leukemia. He needs our help in this time of great need as he has no insurance, is currently unemployed and the cost's of the medical treatments and medicines are crushing. We would very much appreciate any amount that you are able to donate to help him in this battle for his life. Thank you & God bless you for your kindness!!
